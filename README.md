# fastctf-ctfd-landing-page
This is the landing page I created for the Forensics and General CTFs at SCaLE 21x. It can be used interchangably throughout other CTFd-based events in the future. All that needs to be done is downloading the images, upload them to the CTFD platform via the CTFd admin panel, select their paths, and then past them into the ``path =""`` section of the line you want to change.
